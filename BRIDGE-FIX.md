# Bridge Architecture Fix Applied ✅

## Issue Solved: CSP Blocking WebSocket Connections

**Problem**: Twitter's CSP blocks WebSocket connections to Nostr relays
**Solution**: Hybrid architecture with content script bridge

## New Architecture:

### 1. **Content Script (MAIN world)**
- ✅ Has access to `window.nostr` (Alby)
- ✅ Handles UI interactions and event signing
- ✅ Sends signed events via `window.postMessage`

### 2. **Content Bridge (ISOLATED world)**  
- ✅ Has access to `chrome.runtime` APIs
- ✅ Receives messages from main content script
- ✅ Forwards to background script

### 3. **Background Script**
- ✅ No CSP restrictions  
- ✅ Handles WebSocket connections to relays
- ✅ Publishes signed events

## Flow:
```
Click ⚡ → Sign with Alby → Send to Bridge → Publish to Relays → Success ✅
```

## Test Steps:

### 1. Reload Extension (Critical!)
```
chrome://extensions/ → Remove NostrX → Load unpacked → Select folder
```

### 2. Click Lightning Bolt
Expected output:
```
NostrX: Posting directly to Nostr (no background script)
NostrX: window.nostr found, proceeding with post
NostrX: Getting public key from Alby...
NostrX: Got public key: 00cfe60de4f...
NostrX: Signing event...
NostrX: Event signed successfully
NostrX: Sending signed event to background script for relay publishing...
NostrX Bridge: Received publish request
NostrX Background: Publishing signed event to relays
NostrX: Published successfully to X out of 5 relays
NostrX: Post successful
```

### 3. Expected Results:
- ✅ **No CSP errors**
- ✅ **Successful relay publishing**  
- ✅ **Button turns green**
- ✅ **Post appears on Nostr**

## Architecture Benefits:
- **Alby access**: Direct from MAIN world ✅
- **Chrome APIs**: Available in ISOLATED world ✅
- **Relay publishing**: No CSP restrictions in background ✅
- **Reliable communication**: Bridge pattern works ✅

**This should work completely now - reload and test!**
