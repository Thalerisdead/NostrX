# Retry Logic Fix Applied ✅

I've added comprehensive retry logic to handle the timing issue with Alby's `window.nostr` injection.

## Problem Solved:
- **Issue**: `window.nostr` works manually but not when extension tries to access it
- **Cause**: Alby injects `window.nostr` asynchronously after page load
- **Solution**: Added retry logic that waits up to 5 seconds for Alby to be ready

## Changes Made:

### 1. Background Script Retry Logic
- **Nostr Detection**: Retries 10 times (5 seconds) to find `window.nostr`
- **Public Key**: Retries 20 times (5 seconds) to get key from Alby
- **Event Signing**: Retries 20 times (5 seconds) to sign events

### 2. Popup Retry Logic  
- Tests for Alby availability with 10 retries (3 seconds)
- Shows exact status instead of generic errors

### 3. Comprehensive Logging
- Shows attempt numbers and timing
- Logs exactly when Alby becomes available
- Clear success/failure messages

## Test Steps:

### 1. Reload Extension
```
chrome://extensions/ → Remove NostrX → Load unpacked → Select folder
```

### 2. Test Popup
- Go to Twitter/X
- Click NostrX extension icon
- Should show "Nostr extension detected and ready" ✅
- Check console for retry attempt logs

### 3. Test Lightning Bolt
- Click any ⚡ button on a tweet
- Watch console for attempt messages:
  ```
  NostrX: Attempt 1 - Getting public key
  NostrX: Got public key: npub1abc...
  NostrX: Attempt 1 - Signing event  
  NostrX: Event signed successfully
  ```

## Expected Behavior:

**Before Fix**: Immediate failure with "window.nostr not available"  
**After Fix**: Waits for Alby, shows retry attempts, succeeds when ready

## Debug Information:

The console will now show:
- How many attempts it takes to find Alby
- Exactly when `window.nostr` becomes available  
- Success confirmation with partial public key
- Any permission popups from Alby

## Common Results:

- **1-2 attempts**: Alby loads quickly ✅
- **3-10 attempts**: Normal Alby loading time ✅  
- **Max attempts reached**: Alby configuration issue ❌

Try it now - the extension should wait for Alby and work reliably!
