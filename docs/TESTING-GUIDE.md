## Phase 1: Extension Installation

### Step 1: Prepare Icon Files

The extension needs PNG icon files to work properly. You have several options:

#### Option A: Online Converter (Easiest)
1. Open https://cloudconvert.com/svg-to-png in a new tab

7. Place all 4 PNG files in the NostrX folder

#### Option B: Quick Placeholder Icons
If you just want to test functionality quickly:

   - Preferably a short tweet (under 100 characters)

2. **Click Lightning Bolt**
   - Click the ‚ö° button on the tweet
   - Button should immediately change to loading animation (spinning circle)
   - Button color should change to purple

3. **Wait for Result**

     - ‚úÖ Green checkmark = Success
     - ‚ùå Red X = Error

4. **Success Path**

   - Then returns to gray lightning bolt
   - Tweet has been posted to Nostr!

5. **Error Path**
   - If error, button shows red X for 3 seconds
   - Check NostrX popup for error details
   - Common errors and solutions below

### Test 2: Settings Configuration

   - Popup should open

2. **Test Enable/Disable Toggle**
   - Click "Enable NostrX" toggle

   - Try removing a relay (click X button)
   - Try "Reset to Defaults" button

### Test 3: Edge Cases

1. **Long Tweets**
   - Find or create a tweet near 280 character limit
   - Cross-post to test handling of long content

2. **Special Characters**
   - Test tweets with emojis, hashtags, mentions
   - Verify content is preserved correctly

3. **Multiple Rapid Clicks**

## Phase 5: Verification on Nostr

To verify your cross-posts actually made it to Nostr:

### Option A: Use Web Client

1. **Open Nostr Web Client**
   - Go to https://iris.to or https://snort.social
   - Connect with same Nostr extension you used for NostrX

2. **Check Your Posts**
   - Look for your cross-posted tweets
