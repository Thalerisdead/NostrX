# Context Isolation Fix Applied ✅

## Issue Identified: Context Isolation

**Problem**: Your test shows `window.nostr` works in console but is `undefined` when the extension tries to access it.

**Cause**: Chrome extensions run in an isolated context separate from the page's main JavaScript context where Alby injects `window.nostr`.

## Solution Applied:

### 1. **Added `"world": "MAIN"` to manifest.json**
- Content script now runs in the same context as the page
- Direct access to `window.nostr` that Alby provides

### 2. **Moved Nostr operations to content script**
- No more complex background script communication
- Direct access to Alby from content script
- Simpler, more reliable architecture

### 3. **Self-contained posting**
- Content script handles everything: Alby access, signing, relay publishing
- Background script only manages settings storage

## Test Steps:

### 1. Reload Extension (Critical!)
```
chrome://extensions/ → Remove NostrX → Load unpacked → Select folder
```

### 2. Test Context Fix
In Twitter console:
```javascript
console.log('Alby still works:', typeof window.nostr !== 'undefined');
```

### 3. Click Lightning Bolt
Expected new output:
```
NostrX: Posting directly to Nostr (no background script)
NostrX: window.nostr found, proceeding with post
NostrX: Getting public key from Alby...
NostrX: Got public key: npub1abc...
NostrX: Signing event...
NostrX: Event signed successfully
NostrX: Publishing to 5 relays...
NostrX: Published successfully to X out of 5 relays
NostrX: Post successful
```

## Expected Results:

✅ **No more "window.nostr undefined" errors**  
✅ **Direct Alby access from content script**  
✅ **Successful posting to Nostr relays**  
✅ **Button turns green with success checkmark**  

The extension should now work correctly since it runs in the same context where `window.nostr` is available!

**Reload the extension and test again** - this should fix the context isolation issue completely.
